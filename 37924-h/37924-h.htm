<h2>THE LAW OF SUCCESS</h2>


<p>During the winter of 1883 a slim, studious young man was working as
assistant foreman in a greasy little machine shop at Aurora, Illinois. He
was saving money with a view to spending the next year at the State
University, and he was devoting every minute of his spare time to thought
and reading. He was not making much of a stir in the world, and only a few
of his close friends ever gave a second thought to his ambitions or
prospects.</p>

<p>One of these friends was a newspaper reporter, a recent Harvard graduate.
He, too, was interested in study, especially of financial questions, and
he found it a pleasure to guide the reading of the young foreman. Many an
evening the two friends spent in the discussion of great economic and
financial problems. Though both men had their ambitions and dreams, it did
not occur to either one that he would ever play a big part in solving
these problems.</p>

<p>A few years later the Harvard graduate became financial editor of the
<i>Chicago Tribune</i> and brought in the younger man as his assistant.
<!--010.png--><span class="pagenum">8</span>During
their years of newspaper work together they continued to study and think,
and their knowledge of business principles and methods gradually
broadened. They were fitting themselves almost without knowing it to step
forward into positions of leadership.</p>

<p>Today, the former reporter is the head of a great university school of
commerce; the assistant foreman became the president of the largest bank
in the United States. One of these men is Joseph French Johnson, now Dean
of the New York University School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance. The
other is Frank A. Vanderlip, the great financier.</p>

<p>The life histories of most men who have succeeded in a large way are
equally simple. They have looked ahead, they have planned, they have
equipped themselves with all the business knowledge available, and success
has followed. <i>Success must follow.</i> The law of success is as definite as
the law of gravity. Here it is:</p>

<div class="center"><i>Prepare in advance for opportunities.</i></div>

<p>It is not the dramatic moments of life that count. It is the quiet
planning and reading of the man who is getting ready now for what is going
to happen two, five or ten years from now.</p>

<hr class="ChapterTopRule" />
<!--011.png--><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter I</h2>

<div class="c3">THE MODERN BUSINESS COURSE AND SERVICE</div>


<p>As Dean of New York University School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance,
Joseph French Johnson had for many years continually received letters
requesting advice on what to read on business.</p>

<p>These demands came not only from young men, but from mature and able
executives, and sometimes even from the most successful business leaders.
To all such requests Dean Johnson was obliged to reply that the only
practical way to study the fundamental principles of business in a
systematic manner was to attend the lectures in university schools of
commerce.</p>

<p>At that time the literature of business was scanty and for the most part
of doubtful value. Working alone, a man could get but little help in his
efforts to widen and deepen his knowledge of business principles.</p>

<p>It became evident that there was a great need
<!--012.png--><span class="pagenum">10</span>for
an organized, logical
statement of the basic principles on which successful business is founded.
It was determined to establish an institution which should meet the
demand. After years of preparation the Alexander Hamilton Institute was
established in 1909.</p>


<h3>The name</h3>

<p>In selecting the name, it was agreed that none could be so suitable as
that of Alexander Hamilton.</p>

<p>Hamilton is perhaps chiefly remembered for his masterly statesmanship; but
he was equally conspicuous as soldier, financier, author, organizer and
practical economist.</p>

<p>He was without doubt the greatest manager ever employed by the United
States Government. When he became the first Secretary of the Treasury, he
found a chaotic government, without money, without credit, and without
organization. He secured order, provided funds and created prosperity. He
investigated the industries and directed the early commercial development
of the United States. "He touched the dead corpse of the public credit,
and it sprang upon its feet. He smote the rock of the nation's resources
and abundant streams of revenue gushed forth."
<!--013.png--><span class="pagenum">11</span></p>

<p>Hamilton was a great executive and systematizer; he himself worked out an
accounting system for the United States Government which, with but slight
modifications, remained in force for more than a hundred years.</p>


<h3>The plan</h3>

<p>The Modern Business Course and Service is a systematic, time-saving method
of bringing to any man's office or home that business knowledge and
training which he needs, but which he cannot acquire through his own
experience.</p>

<p>It is designed for the benefit of two groups of men:</p>

<div class="blockquot hi"><dl>
<dt>(1) those who already are in executive or semi-executive positions;</dt>
<dt>(2) young men who have brains and the ambition to become business executives.</dt>
</dl></div>

<p>It is intended, in general, for the men who are looking and moving ahead;
for live, keen-witted, energetic men; for men who are not satisfied to
remain in the ranks or in subordinate positions. These men may or may not
have had a thorough school and college training; that is not an essential.
They may or may not have wealth and high position; that is unimportant.
But they <i>must</i>
<!--014.png--><span class="pagenum">12</span>have
ability and enough serious purpose to spend a
portion of their spare time in reading and thinking about business
problems.</p>


<h3>The organization</h3>

<p>The Modern Business Course and Service is conducted by an organization
made up of business and professional men and of university specialists in
business subjects. Inasmuch as such an institution derives its strength
almost wholly from the men who are identified with it, a complete list of
these men, with brief biographical notes to show who they are and what
they have accomplished, is given in Chapter VII, on pages 97 to 118.</p>

<p>The Institute organization consists of four groups:</p>

<dl class="blockquot">
<dt><span class="smcap">Advisory Council</span></dt>
<dt><span class="smcap">Authors and Collaborators</span></dt>
<dt><span class="smcap">Special Lecturers</span></dt>
<dt><span class="smcap">Institute Staff</span></dt>
  <dd><i>a.</i> <span class="smcap">Consultant Staff</span></dd>
  <dd><i>b.</i> <span class="smcap">Administrative Staff</span></dd>
</dl>

<p>Business and educational authority of the highest standing is represented
in the Advisory Council of the Institute.
<!--015.png--><span class="pagenum">13</span></p>

<p><i>This Advisory Council</i> consists of Frank A. Vanderlip, the financier; T.
Coleman duPont, the business executive; John Hays Hammond, the eminent
engineer; Joseph French Johnson, Dean of the New York University School of
Commerce; and Jeremiah W. Jenks, the statistician and economist. The
Council has general supervision and direction of the policies and
activities of the Institute. No important move of any kind is made without
the sanction of this body.</p>

<p><i>The Authors and Collaborators</i> are men prominent in educational and
business circles. As authors, co-authors and collaborators they are
responsible for the Modern Business volumes. Their writing is done under
the guidance and with the cooperation of the Institute's Editorial Board.
Each one is chosen because of his particular training and ability in the
field he covers.</p>

<p><i>The Special Lecturers</i>, whose business connections are stated on pages
111 to 118, are men of high commercial standing who have devoted time and
thought to preparing written lectures for the Modern Business Course and
Service. These lectures present some of the results of their successful
business experience.
<!--016.png--><span class="pagenum">14</span></p>

<p><i>The Institute Staff</i> actively conducts the Modern Business Course and
Service. Many of the members of the Staff are also members of the
faculties of university schools of commerce. Every member of the Staff is
a specialist who in some one business subject is entitled to rank as an
authority. Their names, business and university connections and official
duties in the Institute are stated on pages 100 to 110.</p>

<p>(a) <i>The Consultant Staff</i> are the experts who do not give their entire
time to the Institute, but who are called upon for special information and
advice whenever the occasion requires.</p>

<p>(b) <i>The Administrative Staff</i> consists of the Senior and Junior
Executives who are active in the administrative work of the organization.
These men are heads of the departments responsible for the successful
management of the Alexander Hamilton Institute.</p>


<h3>Subjects covered</h3>

<p>The Modern Business Course and Service brings to a subscriber the
essential business knowledge that he does not acquire in his own
experience. The subject matter of the Course

<h3>Simple, elastic, workable</h3>

<p>The Modern Business Course and Service covers the essential subjects on
which every business man should be well informed.</p>

<p>When an enrolment is accepted, the Institute undertakes,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. <i>To supply the subscriber</i> with the Modern Business Text&mdash;the
most complete and best organized treatment of business
principles and practice that has yet been produced.</p>

<p>2. <i>To guide and illuminate</i> his reading of the Text by a series
of Modern Business Talks.</p>

<p>3. <i>To bring him into touch</i> with the ideas and methods of some
of the foremost business and professional men in the country
through a series of Modern Business Lectures.</p>

<p>4. <i>To give him facilities</i> for applying and testing his
knowledge of business principles through a series of Modern
Business Problems.</p>

<p>5. <i>To keep him informed</i> on current business events and the
trend of future affairs in the commercial world by means of
Monthly Letters on Business Conditions.
<!--020.png--></p>

<p>6. <i>To acquaint him</i> with important
<!--027.png--><span class="pagenum">17</span>events
covering the
production and prices of general commodities and the current
security market.</p>

<p>7. <i>To supply</i> him with four Modern Business Reports on
important problems; the reports to be selected by him from an
extensive list.</p>

<p>8. <i>To render personal service</i> through answers to all inquiries
in connection with his reading of the Course.</p>

</div>

<p>An enrolment for the Modern Business Course and Service covers a period of
two years. During that time each subscriber is constantly in touch with
the members of the Institute Staff. There are no rigid rules&mdash;no red
tape&mdash;to restrict or annoy; instead, there is personal guidance and
sincere cooperation.</p>

<p>The more carefully you consider the plan, the more clearly you will see
how well it is adapted to the needs of busy men who must make every minute
and every ounce of effort produce the greatest possible results.</p>

<p>You will see more clearly the actual scope of the Modern Business Course
and Service if you keep in view its eight main features:</p>

<dl class="blockquot">
<dt>1&mdash;<span class="smcap">Text</span></dt>
<dt>2&mdash;<span class="smcap">Talks</span></dt>
<dt>3&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lectures</span></dt>
<dt>4&mdash;<span class="smcap">Problems</span></dt>
<dt>5&mdash;<span class="smcap">Monthly Letters</span></dt>
<dt>6&mdash;<span class="smcap">Financial and Trade Reviews</span></dt>
<dt>7&mdash;<span class="smcap">Reports</span></dt>
<dt>8&mdash;<span class="smcap">Service</span></dt>
</dl>

<!--028.png--><p><span class="pagenum">18</span></p>


<h3>1&mdash;Text</h3>

<p>The basis of the Course and Service is a series of twenty-four text-books
prepared under the careful supervision of its editors, assisted by
well-known authorities. In some cases the latter appear as authors, in
others as collaborators in the preparation of the Texts.</p>

<p>Dean Joseph French Johnson is Editor-in-Chief of the Course. The managing
editor is Dr. Roland P. Falkner. Associated with them is a large editorial
staff which takes an active share in the writing and preparation of the
Course. The authors and collaborators are specialists who rank as
authorities in their particular field. The series is widely recognized as
the most important contribution yet made to business literature.</p>

<p>The volumes in the Modern Business Series are sold apart from the
Institute Course only to universities for use as prescribed text-books in
classroom work. Among the universities which have used the Institute's
volumes as texts are:</p>

<dl class="blockquot">
<dt>Boston University</dt>

<p>There are about three hundred and fifty pages in each of the twenty-four
volumes. Each volume is carefully indexed and contains, in addition to the
text, a few review suggestions after each chapter which are of great value
in mastering the subject.</p>

<p>Questions of Commercial Law as they affect each subject are discussed in
the volume pertaining to that particular unit of the Course.</p>

<h3>2&mdash;Talks</h3>

<p>The Modern Business Talks, which are sent fortnightly, are informal
discussions of the principles treated in the Text. As the name indicates,
these Talks bring up many specific points and cases, and show more clearly
why and
<!--033.png--><span class="pagenum">23</span>how
the underlying principles of scientific business should be
applied. They are particularly direct, practical and stimulating. Their
periodic visits serve to keep every subscriber in touch with the Institute
Staff and alive to the importance of following the Course systematically.
The Talks are prepared by members of the Institute Staff or other
authorities.</p>

<p>In the pamphlet which contains the Talk the reading assignment for the
following two weeks is suggested. On receiving the fortnightly instalment
of new material, the subscriber will ordinarily read the Talk before
taking up the reading assignment, and thus get a bird's-eye view of the
ground that is to be covered during the succeeding two weeks.</p>

<p>Some of the subjects discussed are:</p>

<dl class="blockquot">
<dt><i>The Shortest Way to the Executive's Chair</i></dt>
<dt><i>The Market Value of Brains</i></dt>
<dt><i>Sharing the Product</i></dt>
<dt><i>Pitfalls of Partnership</i></dt>
<dt><i>A Corporate Venture</i></dt>
<dt><i>Putting the Message Across</i></dt>
<dt><i>The Dominance of Salesmanship</i></dt>
<dt><i>Leading the Sales Force</i></dt>
<dt><i>Credit, the Motive Power of Business</i></dt>
<dt><i>Cost Records as Profit Makers</i></dt>
<dt><i>Overcoming Corporation Difficulties</i></dt>
<dt><i>The Hundred Thousand Dollar Letter</i></dt>
<dt><i>Making Advertising Pay</i></dt>
<dt><i>The Railway a Public Servant</i></dt>
<dt><i>Building Up Your Bank Credit</i></dt>
<dt><i>Cashing in on Foreign Trade</i></dt>
<dt><i>Safeguards of Insurance</i></dt>
<dt><i>What Do You Know About Wall Street?</i></dt>
<dt><i>The Benefits of Speculation</i></dt>
<dt><i>Capitalizing the Auditor's Viewpoint</i></dt>
<dt><i>Basing Decisions on Facts</i></dt>
<dt><i>Reading Accounting Records</i></dt>
<dt><i>Saving Salesmen</i></dt>
<dt><i>Holding the Watch on Your Investment</i></dt>
<dt><i>Satisfying Your Foreign Customer</i></dt>
</dl>

<!--034.png--><p><span class="pagenum">24</span></p>


<h3>3&mdash;Lectures</h3>

<p>The written Modern Business Lectures, which are sent to subscribers
monthly during the two-year Course, have been especially prepared for the
Institute by eminent business executives, publicists and accountants, and
reflect the experience of these men in successfully handling business
problems.</p>

<p>They are intended, first, to show how these men have actually applied the
principles discussed in the Modern Business Course; second, to give
further information as to large and highly developed business concerns and
their methods; and, third, to bring subscribers into closer touch with the
wide circle of representative, successful men of affairs.</p>

<p>Some of the subjects of the Lectures are:</p>

<dl class="blockquot">
<dt><i>Essentials of a Successful Enterprise</i></dt>
<dt><i>The Value of Trade Associations</i></dt>
<dt><i>Marketing a Nationally Advertised Product</i></dt>
<dt><i>Retail Store Management</i></dt>
<dt><i>The Creation of a Selling Organisation</i></dt>
<dt><i>Efficient Credit Management</i></dt>
<dt><i>Organising an Accounting Department</i></dt>
<dt><i>Cost and Efficiency Records</i></dt>
<dt><i>Marketability of Securities</i></dt>
<dt><i>Building a Mail-Order Business</i></dt>
<dt><i>Elements of Effective Advertising</i></dt>
<dt><i>The Railway as a Business Developer</i></dt>
<dt><i>Selling in Foreign Markets</i></dt>
<dt><i>How Banks Serve Business</i></dt>
<dt><i>The Foreign Exchange Field</i></dt>
<dt><i>The Day's Work in Wall Street</i></dt>
<dt><i>Why Business Needs the Auditor</i></dt>
<dt><i>The Investment Security Business</i></dt>
</dl>

<h3>4&mdash;Problems</h3>

<p>One of the strongest features of the Course is the series of twenty-four
Problems&mdash;such problems as accountants, financiers, bankers and business
managers meet in practice&mdash;especially
<!--035.png--><span class="pagenum">25</span>prepared
for the Course by members
of the Institute Staff.</p>

<p>Each Problem is a carefully worded statement of all the essential factors
in some business situation; in other words, the situation is presented and
described just as it might be in the report of a subordinate official to
the head of a business enterprise. The Problems are so arranged as to
correspond closely to the assigned reading. For instance, after the
subject of cost accounts has been discussed, a Problem is given in which a
knowledge of cost accounting principles is called for. Thus, the Problems
serve not merely to test the subscriber's understanding and thinking
power, but also to fix in his mind and make definite the statements and
principles contained in the Text volumes.</p>

<p>When solutions to the Problems are sent in, they are criticised, graded,
and returned with suggestions for further study. Solutions to the Problems
are not, however, required. Some of the titles are:</p>

<dl class="blockquot">
<dt><i>The President's Choice</i></dt>
<dt><i>Advertising the Ayer-Hall Saws</i></dt>
<dt><i>Remodeling the Rowland-Johnson Company's Sales Organization</i></dt>
<dt><i>A Question of Profits and Financial Condition</i></dt>
<dt><i>Three Foreign Exchange Situations</i></dt>
<dt><i>Scudder's System to Beat the Market</i></dt>
<dt><i>The Reorganisation of the Industrial Realty Company</i></dt>
<dt><i>Embarking in Foreign Trade</i></dt>
<dt><i>A Fire and Its Consequences</i></dt>
</dl>


<h3>5&mdash;Monthly Letter on Business Conditions</h3>

<p>A business executive must have a knowledge of the fundamental principles
relating to the internal organization and management of a business.</p>

<p>He should also have a basis of judging those external business conditions
over which no one group of men has control, but to the trend of which
every line of business
<!--036.png--><span class="pagenum">26</span>must
be adjusted in order to gain the maximum of
profit and suffer the minimum of loss.</p>

<p>The results of these studies are presented to the business man in a clear
and concise manner in the Monthly Letter on Business Conditions.</p>

<p>In order to keep subscribers informed regarding the state of business at
home and abroad, and as a basis for applying the principles explained in
the Text, the Monthly Letters will prove most helpful. The economic
experts of our Business Conditions Bureau are constantly bringing together
and interpreting facts and figures regarding bank clearings, pig iron
production, unfilled steel orders, exports and imports, railroad earnings,
and such indices of financial conditions as the reserves, loans and
deposits of the Federal Reserve Banks.</p>

<p>The letters discuss political events and developments in the business
world which have an influence upon price movements and conditions of
activity or depression. The business man will find them particularly
interesting, as they show him what to expect in the future by pointing out
the present trend of affairs.</p>


<h3>6&mdash;Financial and Trade Reviews</h3>

<p>The Financial and Trade Reviews are issued monthly by our Bureau of
Business Conditions and are designed to cover in a timely and interesting
fashion the activities in the security market by analyzing individual and
group securities and by presenting statistics on prices and earnings of
standard stocks and bonds.</p>

<p>The Reviews cover the production and price trends of basic commodities and
matters of interest in foreign fields. Leading articles deal with current
events of note and interest to the business community.</p>

<p>The Financial and Trade Review is a valuable supplement to the principles
brought out in the regular reading schedule.</p>


<h3>7&mdash;Modern Business Reports</h3>

<p>The Modern Business Reports are written by professional and trade experts
and members of the Institute Staff,
<!--037.png--><span class="pagenum">27</span>and
cover both important business
problems of general interest and technical subjects relating to
Accounting, Sales, Office Methods, Merchandising, Production and other
specialized departments.</p>

<p>From time to time a descriptive list of these Reports is sent to each
subscriber. From these lists the subscriber may choose four Reports at any
time during the two-year period of his enrolment.</p>

<p>These Reports run from ten to fifty pages in length. Each one is prepared
in reference to some specific problem and is the result of special
investigation. The subjects cover a wide field, and every subscriber will
find among them a number which are of particular interest to him.</p>

<p>The list of Reports includes such titles as:</p>

<dl class="blockquot">
<dt><i>Preparation for the Accounting Profession</i></dt>
<dt><i>Profit Sharing</i></dt>
<dt><i>Territorial Supervision of Salesmen</i></dt>
<dt><i>Advertising American Goods in Foreign Markets</i></dt>
<dt><i>Analysis of Bank Reports</i></dt>
<dt><i>Promotion and Organization of a Public Service Corporation</i></dt>
<dt><i>The Psychology and Strategy of Collecting</i></dt>
<dt><i>Desk Efficiency</i></dt>
<dt><i>How to Read the Financial Page of a Newspaper</i></dt>
<dt><i>Employes' Pension Systems</i></dt>
<dt><i>Evaluation of Public Utilities</i>.</dt>
</dl>


<h3>8&mdash;Service</h3>

<p>The reading matter of the Modern Business Course is in itself of
remarkable value; subscribers have told us over and over again that one
volume, or sometimes one pamphlet, or one Report, has brought them ideas
worth vastly more than the fee for the Course and Service.</p>

<p>This value is largely enhanced by the fact that back of the reading matter
there is an organization of men who are anxious to cooperate in every way
possible with each subscriber. This organization is equipped to render
service at every stage of the subscriber's progress.
<!--038.png--><span class="pagenum">28</span></p>

<p>First of all, certain members of the Staff are assigned to the pleasant
task of carrying on correspondence with subscribers. They make an earnest
effort whenever a new enrolment is received to get into touch with the
subscriber and learn under what conditions he is working, what experience
and education he has had and what objects he has in view. With this
information before them they can often make suggestions that are directly
helpful and that mean a larger increase in the subscriber's personal
benefit from his use of the Course and Service.</p>

<p>Furthermore, every one who thinks as he reads comes across statements and
opinions which he does not fully understand or which he questions. The
privilege of asking about any such statements or opinions is freely open
to all subscribers. There is no limit whatever to the number of questions
which may be submitted, based on the Text or other reading matter of the
Course.</p>


<h3>The four great activities of business</h3>

<p>There are four fundamental activities in every business&mdash;Production,
Marketing, Financing, and Accounting.</p>

<p>On the following page you will see the whole field of business charted in
such a way as to show clearly the relation of various business activities
to each other. Economics, the study of business conditions and business
policies, is the hub of all business activity. Radiating from it are the
four grand divisions of business&mdash;Production, Marketing, Financing,
Accounting. These in turn are subdivided into the more detailed activities
which they include.</p>

<p>The Modern Business Course and Service is a thorough treatment of all the
divisions indicated.
<!--039.png--></p>

<span class="caption">ECONOMICS</span>
</div>


<h3>A Survey of Modern Business Science</h3>

<p>All business activities may be classified under Production, Marketing,
Financing and Accounting. For purposes of systematic study, each of these
may be subdivided as shown above.</p>

<p>In addition, there are two important forces which control business&mdash;Man
and Government. For that reason a discussion of the relation between
"Business and the Man" and "Business and the Government" naturally forms a
part of the survey of modern business. The first two and the last
<!--040.png-->two
assignments in the Modern Business Course and Service cover these
important subjects.
<!--041.png--><span class="pagenum">29</span></p>

<p>The arrangement of the subjects has been carefully planned so that the
maximum benefit will be derived by following the assignments in their
regular order. In the chart you see the logical arrangement of these
subjects as related to the business world. Note that the order in which
these subjects are treated in the Course is not according to their
arrangement in the chart. On the contrary, the more general subjects are
first considered; then come the more complex&mdash;the specializations and
enlargements upon the foundation subjects. This plan permits a progressive
arrangement that makes for a broad understanding of the science of
business.</p>

<p>Just as any university or college requires a knowledge of certain subjects
before others can be taken up, because this more general knowledge is
essential to a proper understanding of the more advanced, so we have
arranged the subjects treated in the Modern Business Course and Service in
a similar manner.</p>

<p>Texts, Talks, Lectures, Problems, Monthly Letters, Financial and Trade
Reviews, Reports and Service&mdash;these are the important features of the
Modern Business Course and Service.</p>

<h2>Chapter II</h2>

<div class="c3">THE DANGER OF SPECIALIZING TOO EARLY</div>


<p>A great many young men think they have found a quick and easy road to
success by concentrating their minds wholly on the jobs they happen to
hold.</p>

<p>It is perfectly true that a business man must not underestimate the
importance of details.</p>

<p>But it is also true that large success is always built upon a clear
understanding of basic principles.</p>

<p>The common fallacy that it is best for a man&mdash;especially a young man&mdash;to
confine his thought and studies to his own specialty has in many instances
proved ruinous. It is easily possible to specialize so much as to lose all
sense of the importance of a broad, well-balanced business training.</p>

<p>We all know the lawyer who is wrapped up in his quibbles; the accountant
who sees nothing in business but a maze of figures; the advertising man
who is so fascinated by "cleverness" that he
<!--043.png--><span class="pagenum">31</span>forgets
to try to sell
goods; and the technical man who knows nothing about the commercial phases
of his engineering problems.</p>

<p>Such men cannot take their places among the higher executives because they
know little or nothing of business outside their own specialty, and they
cannot know even that thoroughly while their general outlook remains so
narrow.</p>


<h3>Only half ready</h3>

<p>Some years ago two young men of unusual promise graduated from a prominent
School of Mines and went to work for a big copper company as full-fledged
mining engineers. They were located at an isolated camp, remote from
civilization, and were given every chance to make good the prediction made
for them at the time of graduation.</p>

<p>These men soon proved that they knew a great deal about the mining of
copper. Their advancement was rapid, and within a comparatively short time
one of them was appointed General Manager and the other Chief Engineer. To
all intents and purposes they were in complete charge of the company's
interests in that locality.</p>

<p>It was not long before the problems put up to these two mining experts
ceased to be confined to the technical end of the business. The
<!--044.png--><span class="pagenum">32</span>handling
of a large number of men, the disposition of big sums of money, the
necessity of using both men and money economically, the accounting and
statistics of their operations, and a hundred other problems no less
"practical" demanded the exercise of judgment on their part and a
knowledge of business principles that neither their technical training nor
their previous experience had supplied.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these two&mdash;the General Manager and the Chief Engineer&mdash;had
their heads turned by their rapid advancement. They did not recognize the
fact that a thorough business training would have made them well-nigh
failure-proof, and they even expressed contempt for scientific study of
such subjects as accounting, banking, organization, cost finding, selling
and finance.</p>

<p>In course of time the operations of the company made necessary the
extension of its mining facilities, involving the erection of a
concentrator and smelter at an expenditure of a little over $2,000,000.
These men were in charge of selecting and arranging for the sites and
erection of the plants. The work had gone forward to a considerable extent
when one of the executive officers of the company from the East came to
inspect the properties and the progress of the new work. He was so
disappointed at the lack
<!--045.png--><span class="pagenum">33</span>of
business judgment displayed in the selection
of the sites, the drawing of contracts and other matters, that he
dismissed the Chief Engineer on the spot, and curtailed the authority of
the General Manager.</p>

<p>He stated that thereafter he would select men who had some business as
well as technical training.</p>

<p>These men missed success because they lacked certain essential tools with
which to build it. Equipped with an elaborate professional kit gathered
through years of painstaking study, they still lacked that knowledge of
business principles which was necessary to enable them to turn their
technical knowledge into results.</p>

<p>Every one who holds, or expects ever to hold, a position of business
responsibility should be familiar with the whole field of modern business.
The reasons for this are apparent to any one who has to do with the
handling of large problems. It is necessary always to take into account
<i>all</i> the important factors in such problems. No matter how ably a
marketing or an accounting difficulty may be met, the solution is worse
than useless if it affects unfavorably any other phase of the business.</p>

<p>A business executive cannot afford to make many serious mistakes. To guard
against mistakes, he must be fortified with an all-round
<!--046.png--><span class="pagenum">34</span>knowledge
of
business practice&mdash;not merely a partial or one-sided knowledge.</p>

<p>The principles of Production, Marketing, Financing and Accounting are
fundamental and apply to all lines of business. The man who says they do
not apply because his business is "different" is simply exposing his
failure to get down to rock bottom in his thinking. Every business has its
points of difference, just as every man has an individuality of his own.
But we know that human nature, broadly speaking, is much the same in all.
In a like sense all business moves along similar lines. It all consists of
producing, marketing, financing and accounting.</p>

<p>The broad principles of modern business science, therefore, govern all
business. They are related to <i>your</i> problems, no matter how "different"
your business may appear to be on the surface.</p>

<h2>Chapter III</h2>

<div class="c3">PUSHING BEYOND THE HALF-WAY MARK</div>


<p>There is always a danger of half-way success. A man may be at the head of
an office, a department, a sales force, or a business, and yet be only a
half-way success, if what he has so far accomplished be measured against
his actual capacity. Most men, in fact, possess native ability sufficient
to carry them forward into bigger positions than those they now occupy.
But to accomplish that result it is necessary to keep continually moving
ahead.</p>

<p>Chief among the characteristics that carry men past the half-way mark on
the road to success is eagerness to keep on learning more about business
principles and business methods.</p>

<p>The late Marshall Field said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The man who puts ten thousand dollars additional capital into
an established business is pretty certain of increased returns;
and in the same way the man who puts additional capital into his
brains&mdash;information, well directed thought and study of

<!--048.png--><span class="pagenum">36</span>possibilities&mdash;will
as surely&mdash;yes, more surely&mdash;get increased
returns. There is no capital and no increase of capital safer
and surer than that."</p></div>

<p>The ablest men in business are constant students. Many of the foremost
business executives of the United States have for this reason welcomed an
opportunity to enrol for the Modern Business Course and Service. This
Course and Service brings to them in convenient, time-saving form, an
explanation of working principles that have proved successful in every
line of business.</p>


<h3>The kind of men enrolled</h3>

<p>Presidents of big corporations are often enrolled for the Modern Business
Course and Service along with ambitious younger men in their employ. Among
the 145,000 subscribers are such men as:</p>

<dl class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -2em; padding-left: 2em;">
<dt>H. S. Kimball, President of the Remington Arms Corporation</dt>
<dt>John J. Arnold, President of the Bankers' Union of Foreign Commerce and Finance</dt>
<dt>E. R. Behrend, President of the Hammermill Paper Company</dt>
<dt>H. C. Osborn, President, American Multigraph Sales Company</dt>
<dt>Melville W. Mix, President of the Dodge Manufacturing Company</dt>
<dt>William H. Ingersoll, Marketing Manager of Robt. H. Ingersoll and Brothers</dt>
<dt>Charles E. Hires, President, Hires Root Beer Company</dt>
<dt>P. W. Litchfield, Vice-President of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company</dt>
<dt>Ezra Hershey, Treasurer, Hershey Chocolate Company</dt>
<dt>William A. Candler, Secretary, Coca-Cola Company</dt>
<dt>George M. Verity, President, American Rolling Mill Company</dt>
<dt>Charles E. Murnan, Vice-President, United Drug Company</dt>
<dt>W. F. MacGlashan, President, The Beaver Board Companies</dt>
<dt>H. D. Carter, General Manager, Regal Shoe Company<!--049.png--></dt>
<dt>Francis A. Countway, President of Lever Brothers Company (<i>Manufacturers of Lux and Lifebuoy Soap</i>)</dt>
<dt>E. E. Amick, Vice-President, First National Bank of Kansas City</dt>
<dt>Raymond W. Stevens, Vice-President, Illinois Life Insurance Company</dt>
<dt>Roy W. Howard, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Scripps-McRae Newspapers</dt>
<dt>Stephen B. Mambert, Vice-President, Thomas A. Edison Industries</dt>
<dt>S. L. Avery, President, United States Gypsum Company</dt>
<dt>&mdash;and scores of others equally prominent.</dt>
</dl>

<p>These men, and thousands of other Institute subscribers, know that a study
of the principles which have brought unusual success to other men
increases their own capacity for further achievement.</p>


<p>Great business organizations</p>

<p>Officers, department heads and juniors of a large number of important
companies are enrolled for the Modern Business Course and Service. The
prime purpose of the Course and Service is to develop the business
knowledge and judgment of each subscriber, and the heads of these
companies realize that the increased efficiency on the part of individuals
which results from this training carries with it greater efficiency and
profits for their companies.</p>

<p>The tendency in large business organizations, unless the chief executives
are unusually thoughtful and far-sighted, is to repress initiative and
constructive thinking except on the part of the few men who direct the
affairs. The Modern
<!--050.png--><span class="pagenum">38</span>Business
Course and Service counteracts this
tendency. It encourages thought and initiative. It develops men. It
stimulates the whole organization and makes possible more rapid expansion
and larger earnings.</p>

<p>Among the progressive concerns in which a number of men have been making
effective use of the Modern Business Course and Service are:</p>

<p>Many of the men enrolled in these great companies are heads of their
organizations; presidents and vice-presidents. Most of them are important
officials and department heads; a few are men with smaller
responsibilities.</p>

<p>The sound business reason which underlies the favorable action of so many
great corporations is well expressed by President George M. Verity, of the
American Rolling Mill Company, who says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"When I learned that some fifty of our men had decided to take
up the Modern Business Course
<!--052.png--><span class="pagenum">40</span>and
Service, the stock of this
company rose several points in my estimation."</p></div>

<p>The following expressions regarding the value of the Course to men in big
corporations are typical of many that we have received:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We have been familiar with your Course of instruction ever
since it was first offered, and regard it as an excellent one
for men engaged in the investment security business. A large
number of our men are taking the Course, and we have recommended
it to many of our associates."</p></div>

<div style="text-align: right; padding-right: 10%;"><span class="smcap">Spencer Trask &amp; Company</span>,<br /><i>Investment Bankers,
New York City</i>.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Realizing my lack of experience, I subscribed to your Course
and found it of incalculable value. It gave me quickly the
fundamentals of accounting, of which I had known nothing. It
gave me a broad elementary insight into modern marketing
methods. The volume on credits was also helpful. The Course
saved me many expensive blunders.</p>

<p>"Briefly, for one starting in a business of his own I consider
the Alexander Hamilton Institute Course practically
indispensable. In addition to its indirect value, I have been
able to put a definite worth on this Course, to myself and the
firm, of many thousands of dollars."</p></div>

in business fundamentals. Wherever the wheel of business turns&mdash;the need
is great. It is a matter to be reckoned with by every man and concern in
business.</p>

<h2>Chapter IV</h2>


<div class="c3">A PERSONAL PROBLEM</div>

<p>How is it possible that the Modern Business Course and Service should be
helpful alike to the grizzled executive and to the young man who has not
yet made his mark in business? Why is it that in a great many
organizations our list of subscribers begins with the president, includes
practically all the officers and department heads, and ends with a
selected group of men who as yet are in subordinate positions?</p>

<p>The answer is simple. The main problem of every business man is the
problem of developing himself. It makes no difference how great or how
small a man's position may be, the only way to enlarge his influence and
his income is first to enlarge himself. The greatest business men in the
country are quickest to accept and apply this truth.</p>

<p>It may sometimes appear as though a man becomes a bigger business man by
being promoted
<!--056.png--><span class="pagenum">44</span>into
a bigger job. The truth is just the reverse. The big
job naturally gravitates to the well-trained, capable man. If the job
proves too large for the man, it doesn't take long for it to shrivel until
it becomes a perfect fit.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a man who really becomes bigger than his job simply
grows out of it and into another; or he enlarges the job and its rewards
to fit his measure.</p>


<h3>Where do you belong?</h3>

<p>You are a member of one or the other of these two groups:</p>

<div class="blockquot hi"><p>(1) <i>those who have "arrived"</i></p>

<p>(2) <i>those who are on their way toward success.</i></p></div>

<p>There is, to be sure, a third group which unfortunately constitutes an
overwhelming majority, the group made up of purposeless drifters who have
no special ambitions and usually little native ability. To this group the
Institute has nothing to offer.</p>

<p>They might refuse indignantly to sign a contract to work for the next ten
years at the same salary they are now receiving. Yet the end of the
ten-year period will find most of them in the same position, or only a
trifle ahead.
<!--057.png--></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<a href="images/image057.png" target="_blank">Larger.</a>
</div>

<!--058.png--><p><span class="pagenum">46</span></p>

<p>For there is only one power in the world that can lift a man, and that is
the power of added knowledge and training.</p>

<p>For years the Alexander Hamilton Institute has specialized in one thing;
it has only one Course; its sole business is to take men who know one
department of business, and by adding to their equipment a knowledge of
the other fundamentals shown on the chart on the preceding page, to fit
them for higher positions.</p>

<p>If you already have reached a business position of large responsibility,
that surely does not mean that you have stopped growing. The boundless
opportunities that are open to all are beckoning you on. No noteworthy
business man attains his full development until he is well past middle
age. In fact, the man of real power never appears to have reached his
limit. Your real achievements are still ahead of you. As you look over the
pages following, you will see that the brainiest executives in the country
are using the Modern Business Course and Service as equipment for still
bigger undertakings.</p>

<p>If you are still trudging in the ranks, or if you have advanced only part
way toward your goal, you will be keenly interested in the comments of
those who have found the Modern Business Course and Service an immense
help in hastening their progress. These men are rapidly
<!--059.png--><span class="pagenum">47</span>forging
ahead.
They are setting a faster and faster pace. Unless you are able to keep up
with them, you must drift to the rear.</p>

<p>Because the young men of this generation are getting a better training
than has been available in previous generations, the standards of business
ability have risen and will continue to rise. Yesterday, a man of limited
experience and training was often able to force his way into an executive
position; today, it is much more difficult to do so; tomorrow, it will be
impossible.</p>

<p>The business leaders of a few short years from now will be the men who
today are preparing themselves for the duties of leadership.</p>


<h3>Your gains</h3>

<p>You may ask: "<i>What can the Institute do for me?</i>"</p>

<p>The answer to your question is outlined in the "Chart of the Modern
Business Course and Service" which is printed on page <a href="#Page_49">49</a>. That Chart shows
how the organized knowledge about business principles and business
practice which has been collected and classified by the Alexander Hamilton
Institute is transmitted to subscribers through the eight features of the
Course and Service&mdash;Text, Talks, Lectures, Problems,
<!--060.png--><span class="pagenum">48</span>Monthly
Letters,
Financial and Trade Reviews, Reports, and Service.</p>

<p><i>In what ways can a business man cash in on this knowledge?</i> A great many
direct and practical benefits that naturally follow the use of the Modern
Business Course and Service might be cited. Seven of the most important
are shown in the Chart on the following page.</p>

<p>The most obvious and direct benefit consists in a <span class="smcap">Better Understanding of
Sound Business Principles</span>.</p>

<p>The other benefits shown on the Chart are:</p>

<dl class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -2em; padding-left: 2em;">
<dt><span class="smcap">Ability to plan effectively</span></dt>
<dt><span class="smcap">Increased confidence in handling big deals</span></dt>
<dt><span class="smcap">Ability to make quicker and more accurate decisions</span></dt>
<dt><span class="smcap">More leisure for recreation and constructive thought</span></dt>
<dt><span class="smcap">Increased ability to handle men</span></dt>
<dt><span class="smcap">Insurance against mistakes.</span></dt>
</dl>

<p>Note on the following pages what subscribers
<!--062.png--><span class="pagenum">50</span>for
the Modern Business
Course and Service have to say in that connection.</p>


<h3>Better understanding</h3>

<p>A man cannot go far in business unless he <i>thinks</i>. And he must not only
think, but think straight. His conclusions must be based on sound
principles.</p>

<p>Unless a man is thinking along right lines, he will have little
initiative, and his judgment will be poor.</p>

<p>The necessity for every live business man to understand the principles
upon which modern business is based cannot be overstated. The Modern
Business Course and Service gives that understanding. It illuminates
points that were obscure and it answers many puzzling questions. It lights
up the road ahead, so that the business man can see more clearly the path
that he should take.</p>

<p>Mr. Wm. H. Ingersoll, Marketing Manager for the famous Ingersoll watch,
says that the Modern Business Course and Service</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"gives the first coherent presentation of the entire subject of
business. It gives one a perspective and an appreciation of
essentials, as well as much knowledge regarding right and wrong
methods of procedure."</p></div>

<p>As a fair example of the manner in which the Modern Business Course and
Service stimulates
<!--063.png--><span class="pagenum">51</span>thought
and leads to progressive action, even in
companies that already were well organized and highly successful, take the
following note from Mr. Norman W. Wilson, Vice-President of the Hammermill
Paper Company:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Every moment's time I have devoted to it has been well
rewarded. I want you to know what a high regard I have for the
work you are doing and to know that I make it a point to
encourage our people here to study your Course."</p></div>

<p>Mr. J. H. Hansen, President of the J. H. Hansen Cadillac Company of Omaha,
emphasizes the practical information that the Modern Business Course and
Service has brought to him:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"When I located in Nebraska as a salesman for the Cadillac
automobile, a representative of the Institute persuaded me that
I might just as well try for the big prizes in business as for
one of the mediocre ones. The decision to enrol in the Modern
Business Course and Service was a turning-point in my life.</p>

<p>"I knew something about selling already. But now I began to see
business as a whole, and the relation of each department to it.
Advertising and costs; accounting and office organization; the
control of men, and corporation finance&mdash;all these elements,
which are necessary if a man is to succeed in business for
himself, came to me with the Institute's help.</p>

<p>"When the opportunity arrived I was ready for it. We organized
our company and the first year did more than a million dollar
business.</p>

<p>"In my judgment, the reason why so many men never get into
business for themselves or fail after
<!--064.png--><span class="pagenum">52</span>they
do get in, is
because they are not prepared for their opportunity when it
comes."</p></div>

<p>Mr. H. C. Smith, President, Allith-Prouty Manufacturing Company, Chicago,
states why the Modern Business Course and Service is helpful without being
revolutionary:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"All men who have been successful must be credited with having
good business principles. Your Course does not require changing
these principles, but it will broaden one's own ideas and enable
him to get greater results."</p></div>


<h3>Increased confidence</h3>

<p>A great many men accomplish less than their abilities and energy entitle
them to accomplish, simply because they do not feel sure of themselves.
The boldest man alive becomes uncertain and timid in the face of
unfamiliar difficulties. The man who follows the Modern Business Course
and Service becomes acquainted at close range with business difficulties
as well as with tried methods of overcoming them; he learns how to tackle
such difficulties and goes forward without fear or misgivings.</p>

<p>The series of Modern Business Problems which constitute an important
feature of the Modern Business Course and Service is especially intended
to cultivate familiarity with difficult business situations and thereby to
create self-confidence.
<!--065.png--><span class="pagenum">53</span>They
are problems of the kind which executives
are constantly meeting. The man who can solve them successfully should
have no difficulty when he meets similar problems that arise in his own
work.</p>

<p>A better and broader grasp of the principles and practices that underlie
all business also suggests ways of widening the scope of one's business
activity and gives the necessary confidence to go ahead and do it. Mr.
John McBride, of McBride's Theatre Ticket Office, New York, wrote us after
completing the Modern Business Course:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The average man can double his faith in himself in a few months
if he will master the fundamentals of business through your
training."</p></div>

<p>Mr. W. H. Schmelzel, President of the W. H. Schmelzel Company, of St.
Paul, Minnesota, wrote after he had followed the Course:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is my personal opinion that every young business man of
today depends a great deal on consultation or advice from a
successful and experienced adviser or friend on all matters of a
business nature.</p>

<p>"In the early days of my business experience I was confronted
with the task of making decisions preparing myself for the
problems I was to solve in the years to follow. Having been born
and raised in a small town in a Western State, I was content
with advice and consultation of my acquaintances in matters
pertaining to the thoughts I wished to carry out.
<!--066.png--><span class="pagenum">54</span></p>

<p>"I was, therefore, eager to obtain assistance from a corps of
experts in their particular line, and after giving your Modern
Business Course considerable scrutiny, and being informed on the
class of men, that I felt confident of their success, and I
realized that such a Course had merit, and one which I could
afford to consult, advise with and build my future with ideas
and methods you had so ably worked out."</p></div>


<h3>Quicker decisions</h3>

<p>Is the ability to decide things quickly an inborn faculty? No, it is
largely a habit of mind which anyone may cultivate in himself. However, we
must bear in mind that it is necessary not only to decide quickly; there
must be very few mistakes. This requires a mind that is trained to grasp a
situation and to think accurately as well as rapidly.</p>

<p><i>The secret of quick and accurate decision is knowledge of principles.</i> If
a man knows what principle applies in handling a given case, he has no
difficulty in making up his mind and deciding what to do. If the balance
sheet of a given concern were laid before you and you were asked to decide
at once (assuming that the figures were correct) whether to ship a $10,000
order of goods to that company, possibly you would not know what to say.
But if you were familiar with the definite principles of accounting and
finance which would enable you
<!--067.png--><span class="pagenum">55</span>to
analyze that balance sheet and make it
yield a vivid picture of the financial condition of the concern, you would
not hesitate a moment. You would reply instantly.</p>


<h3>What decision meant to this man</h3>

<p>A young man, whose name we are not at liberty to give, told us of a
dramatic incident which illustrates the value that keen business men
attach to preparedness and quick decisions. Up to about a year ago this
young man was head accountant for his company. The Board of Directors had
been in session about an hour one afternoon when a messenger came to his
desk and told him that he was wanted in the board room.</p>

<p>As he entered the room the president snapped at him, "Would you advise us
to issue a block of collateral trust bonds to finance a new addition to
our factory which will cost about $60,000?"</p>

<p>"No," said the accountant, "the company's credit is good enough for an
issue of $60,000 one to three-year notes without security. If necessary,
the new building could be mortgaged after construction, and, at the
present rate, the business could pay off the whole loan in five years."</p>

<p>A rapid-fire series of questions followed, covering
<!--068.png--><span class="pagenum">56</span>the
financial,
advertising and sales policy of the firm, to each of which the accountant
gave concentrated thought, quick decision and convincing reply.</p>

<p>The president's final question was, "How would you like to become
treasurer of this company at $6,000 a year?"</p>

<p>In the letter that told of this incident this subscriber said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I don't know whether I owe most to you or to my friend in the
Carnegie Steel Company who urged me to enrol for your Course and
Service. I could have answered few if any of the questions asked
me without the knowledge I gained from it. I found out later
that the president knew all the time I was following your
Course, and wanted to prove to the rest of the directors that I
could intelligently consider and discuss business problems."</p></div>

<p>Mr. Charles C. Chase, in the Advertising Department of Brown Company, of
Portland, Maine, brings out another method of securing help in deciding
questions that are outside the scope of his previous experience. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"To the fellows who have asked me about the Course and what I
believe it will do for them, I have said:</p>

<p>"Through a subscription to the Course of the Alexander Hamilton
Institute you not only ally yourself with a "Board of Directors"
whose combined business experience probably amounts to at least
five hundred successful years&mdash;a Board the
<!--069.png--><span class="pagenum">57</span>members
of which
have had specialized experience in every important phase of
business&mdash;but who have been assembled for the very definite
purpose of helping men."</p></div>

<p>This method is equally valuable to the executive, according to Mr. Lynn P.
Talley, Deputy Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Whenever I am confronted with a problem relating to fundamental
economic conditions of business practice or business policy, I
find great comfort and satisfaction in taking down the volume
relating to the subject and always find elucidation of the
problems that confront me."</p></div>

<p>Mr. James P. Robertson, of Smith, Robertson and Company, Seattle, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"As a general reading Course on business I can truthfully say it
is high grade, and can recommend it to anyone interested in the
study of business."</p></div>

<p>Mr. A. E. Winger, President, American Lithographic Company, writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I think your Course is an excellent one and am particularly
impressed with the underlying thought that I find throughout the
entire Course&mdash;application of principles. It has been my
experience that sound judgment is the most essential requisite
of any executive, and that the judgment required in business
today can best be formed by a thorough knowledge of business
principles."</p></div>

<!--070.png--><p><span class="pagenum">58</span></p>

<p>Mr. Samuel Cochrane, President, Cochrane Chemical Company, Jersey City,
sums up the argument in this remark:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If I had enrolled with you a year or two ago, I should be
better able to handle the problems put up to me every day."</p></div>


<h3>More leisure</h3>

<p>The secret of leisure is not to do less work, but to organize work so that
a greater volume can be handled in less time. No active man wishes to cut
down his productive efforts. A great many men, however, are so tied to
their business tasks by detail and routine that they have little time or
energy left for constructive thought. Frequently they do not get enough
recreation and physical exercise to keep them in prime condition. As a
result, they are frittering away the best years of their life in handling
small details that never bring them anywhere.</p>

<p>To a greater or lesser extent, this is true of all of us. How to escape
from the time-wasting energy-absorbing routine and details is a vital
question.</p>

<p>Being "swamped with too much detail" is in reality a kind of business
disease&mdash;and a very dangerous one. It is most likely to attack the
officers of rapidly expanding concerns and energetic,
<!--071.png--><span class="pagenum">59</span>ambitious
men who
are constantly taking on new responsibilities. Unless one can shake off
this disease, it will probably go on eating away more and more of his time
and energy until he loses his grip on large affairs and to his chagrin,
sees other men of smaller ability rising above him. It is as bad for a man
to be "too busy" as for him to be not busy enough.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it is unnecessary for any man to be so harassed with
details&mdash;except as a temporary condition&mdash;that he cannot give a reasonable
amount of time to recreation, reading and thought. The company burdened by
the detail-type of executive is not getting what it pays for. His natural
abilities are being diverted to things that cheaper men could do equally
well. He owes it to his company, as well as to himself, to reorganize his
work.</p>


<h3>Cutting out the details</h3>

<p>It is necessarily true in all such cases that many of the over-busy man's
duties recur day after day. They are of a semi-routine nature and could be
made wholly routine by giving the proper instructions to some one else. In
other words, this is a problem of organization similar to that of
organizing a factory, a store, or a
<!--072.png--><span class="pagenum">60</span>body
of men. The principles that are
discussed in the Modern Business Course and Service apply to an individual
just as well as to a company. A man can organize his desk very much on the
same plan that he would organize a factory. When he does so, he invariably
finds that his efficiency is increased, his work is more productive, and
he himself has more leisure.</p>

<p>Accordingly, any business man who desires to forge ahead should reduce the
details of his work to routine which can be carried on without special
thought. The Modern Business Course and Service is a direct and invaluable
aid to the man who feels himself tied down by details.</p>

<p>Of course, we must consider in this connection the man who thinks that he
is much busier than he really is. There are spare moments in every man's
day. There is the half-hour before or after the evening meal; the time
spent in traveling to and from work; the one or two evenings a week that
even the busiest man should spend at home. The measure of a man's chances
of success may readily be taken by learning the manner in which he
uses&mdash;or wastes&mdash;his spare time.</p>

<p>No better use can be made of these odd moments than in reading the Modern
Business Course. This reading is not tiring; it is recreative
<!--073.png--><span class="pagenum">61</span>and
stimulating. It will enable any man to organize his work so as to increase
his leisure for reading and study. It will help him to rise to a higher
level where his thought and energy will be more productive.</p>

<p>Many of the big business executives are investing their spare moments in
just this way. They realize the great results that are bound to follow. It
is unquestionably true that the use of one's spare moments count heavily
in determining how much will be accomplished a year or two hence.</p>

<p>The following also give their opinion:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"For a good many years as a practising mining engineer, I
gradually began to realize that there was something wrong with
engineers in regard to their business success. Something that
seemed to stand between the most brilliant of men and success in
business. After a long study of men and conditions, I subscribed
to your Course. From then on I began to take greater
responsibilities and larger fees because of my added confidence
and business knowledge. I truly feel that your course ferried me
across to that phase of professional grasp where I became
successful in business as a professional engineer."</p></div>

<div style="text-align: right; padding-right: 10%;">GLENVILLE A. COLLINS,<br />
<i>Consulting Engineer of Seattle.</i></div>

<p>Much the same thoughts are admirably expressed by another busy executive,
Mr. J. H.
<!--074.png--><span class="pagenum">62</span>Carter,
Vice-President, National City Bank of New York:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"You will no doubt be interested to know that the class formed
under the auspices of the City Bank Club to follow the Alexander
Hamilton Institute Course, which you helped start about two
years ago last Spring, is just completing its study.</p>

<p>"The majority of the original enrolment of fifty members have
followed the Course regularly. It has held the interest of the
men throughout and has proved unusually stimulating and
interesting.</p>

<p>"The official staff of the bank has given the class its hearty
moral support, and, in addition, has offered to refund a part of
the fee to those completing the Course successfully. We feel
that this policy has not only encouraged the men, but has
benefited the bank as well.</p>

<p>"Personally, I cannot speak too highly of the Course. I feel
that the time I have given to it during the past few years could
not have been employed to greater advantage."</p></div>


<h3>Increased ability to handle men</h3>

<p>There are just two factors that determine a man's competence to direct the
work of other men:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. His superior knowledge of the work in hand.</p>

<p>2. His ability to command respect.</p></div>

<p>As a matter of fact, the second factor is almost wholly included in the
first. The man who really knows what he is talking about always commands
respect. The man who is largely a
<!--075.png--><span class="pagenum">63</span>"bluff,"
no matter how "magnetic" or
forceful his personality, is soon found out and retired in favor of the
man of smaller pretensions, but more knowledge. The history of almost any
business success demonstrates the truth of this statement.</p>

<p>Modern business affairs are so complex that it is wholly out of the
question to put an untrained man in command. One might as well talk of
putting an untrained man in charge of a modern battleship. In both
positions broad-gauge knowledge and judgment are absolutely essential. The
same principle applies equally to the minor commands. The leading business
men of the country are for the most part quiet, self-controlled men, who
think before they speak and who are constantly studying business problems.
This is the type of man best fitted to control and direct the work of
others.</p>

<p>The man who develops himself, develops his ability to handle men. Through
the Modern Business Course and Service the training can be secured that
makes for self-development and for success.</p>

<p>T. H. Bailey Whipple, of the Publicity Department of the Westinghouse
Electric Company, writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Your Course unquestionably does for men what experience and
native ability alone can never do."</p></div>

<!--076.png--><p><span class="pagenum">64</span></p>

<p>Mr. G. E. Lucas, Office Efficiency Engineer, Sayles Finishing Plants,
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I am indeed glad that I took the opportunity to enrol for the
Modern Business Course and Service. What I have obtained has
been of very material benefit to me. My own experience bears on
the experience of my other colleagues who have been getting help
and information from you in the past two years. All the reports
that we have obtained have been thoroughly satisfactory and very
complete."</p></div>

<p>The experience of Mr. S. G. McMeen, President, Columbus Railway Power and
Light Company, Columbus, Ohio, is equally to the point:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"My experience began many years ago in technical lines and
continued along them to engineering and construction practice.
As often happens, this technical work led me into executive
matters. It was in them that I missed some of the advantages
enjoyed by men who have specialized earlier in commercial and
financial work.</p>

<p>"Naturally I formed a habit of appropriating the needed
knowledge wherever I might find it, and found much more than I
could assimilate. The long-felt need, therefore, was for a
source of classified information for reference and study, a
source of training by the use of intelligent problems and a
source of advice to which I might turn when in doubt. This
source I found in the volumes, periodical literature and service
of the Alexander Hamilton Institute."</p></div>

<!--077.png--><p><span class="pagenum">65</span></p>


<h3>Larger income and success</h3>

<p>As the diagram on page 49 indicates, the seven direct aids which
subscribers obtain from the Modern Business Course and Service are:</p>

<dl class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -2em; padding-left: 2em;">
<dt>1. Better understanding of business principles</dt>

<dt>2. Ability to plan more effectively</dt>

<dt>3. Increased confidence in handling big problems</dt>

<dt>4. Quicker and more accurate decisions</dt>

<dt>5. More time for constructive thinking</dt>

<dt>6. Greater ability to handle men</dt>

<dt>7. Knowledge that prevents mistakes</dt>
</dl>

<p>All of these aids to personal efficiency are bound to result in increased
income and greater success. Even though a man should gain only slightly in
any one of the seven qualities named, he would become a far better
business man. He would either advance in position or expand his
business&mdash;in either case raising himself to a higher level of income and
success. The effect is all the more striking when a man increases his
efficiency in respect to all seven qualities. To cite examples seems
almost unnecessary. Yet a few typical expressions from subscribers may be
of interest:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is very hard to put into words just how much good I have
derived from the Alexander Hamilton Institute Course, but I do
realize that as problems present themselves, they are much
easier to solve, and I have a better conception of the future
outlook of business since having the benefit of your Course, and
there is scarcely a day but what some matter comes up for which
I use your Course."</p></div>

<div style="text-align: right; padding-right: 10%;">Mr. W. C. ROOSE, <i>Sec'y and Gen. Mgr.</i><br />

<div class="blockquot"><p>"During the past two years my salary has increased more than
400%. This has been due to the rather remarkable increase the
Fuller Brush Company has had in sales. These sales are
indirectly the result of the ideas I have received from your
Course."</p></div>

</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"To the man who has had the advantage of a college education
this Course opens up what might be called a vista of the
business world in a very unique manner. The information obtained
from this course, if acquired by the ordinary college man by
actual experience, would require no less than a lifetime and it
is presented in such a manner as to be readily assimilated in
the short space of two years, devoting only odd hours to study."</p></div>

<div style="text-align: right; padding-right: 10%;">Mr. E. J. BARTELLS, <i>Manager</i><br />
<i>Wood Pipe Export Company, Seattle, Washington</i></div>

<p>A subscriber from a prosperous city in Iowa recently called at the New
York offices of the Alexander Hamilton Institute, saying that he wanted to
meet some of the men who had given him such valuable assistance. He is the
controller of a large manufacturing company and a thoroughly trained and
expert accountant. The thing that impressed him most about the plan of the
Modern Business Course and Service was the opportunity it offered him of
increasing his already extensive knowledge of the principles of finance,
management, advertising, selling and organization, as well as accounting.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you what happened to me a few weeks ago," he said. "I found
myself up against a problem that never had arisen in my
<!--079.png--><span class="pagenum">67</span>previous
experience. I was simply stumped. I sought help from various sources in
attempting to find a satisfactory solution. Then it occurred to me&mdash;the
most obvious things often come to mind last&mdash;to look in the Modern
Business texts for a ray of light. To my great delight, there I found a
clear and definite statement of the very principles that should be
applied.</p>

<p>"I am frank to say to you," he concluded, "that this one bit of
information was worth to me at least three times the price of your
Course." Already this subscriber had realized a 300 per cent dividend on
his investment. Of his subsequent gains we have no record. To the great
majority of those who subscribe for the Course and Service the returns are
simply incalculable. The training, the information and the ideas that they
secure are a big&mdash;often an essential&mdash;factor in making their business
careers happier and more successful. Who can calculate the money value of
a return of that kind?</p>

<p>The moderate fee which is charged for the Modern Business Course and
Service is based directly upon the cost of producing the literature
included in the Course and of maintaining the organization that conducts
the Course and Service. The fee is small in itself; it shrinks into
insignificance when compared with the returns.
<!--080.png--><span class="pagenum">68</span>One
of our subscribers was
speaking only the literal truth when he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"To the man of ability and brains, your Course and Service
offers a <i>priceless</i> means of developing these qualities to
their highest efficiency."</p></div>


<h3>For the woman in business</h3>

<p>The Modern Business Course and Service makes the same appeal to the
business woman as it does to the business man. Consequently a number of
women are enrolled for it. Among these women are:</p>

<div class="blockquot hi">

<p>Mrs. E. M. Simon, President, R. &amp; H. Simon Company, Union Hill,
New Jersey</p>

<p>Miss Sara F. Jones, Mgr. Woman's Dept., Equitable Life Assurance
Society, Chicago, Illinois</p>

<p>Mrs. M. K. Alexander, Solicitor, Equitable Life Assurance
Society, Chicago, Illinois</p>

<p>Miss Mary R. Cass, Manager, F. N. Burt Company, Buffalo, New
York</p>

<p>Miss Louise Messner, Accountant, Petermann Stores Company,
Kearsarge, Michigan</p>

<p>Miss S. F. Troutman, Secretary and Assistant to Treasurer, First
Presbyterian Church, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</p>

<p>Mrs. N. M. Favor, Assistant Cashier, The Travelers Insurance
Company, Manchester, New Hampshire</p>

</div>

<p>Today women are engaged in all branches of business. A great number of
women occupy executive and other important positions in some of the large
concerns of the country, and the number is steadily increasing. For the
ambitious woman a career in business, with its great rewards and the
possibilities of rendering worthy service, holds forth attractive
opportunities.</p>

of the highest quality. And for the same
reason you know that it naturally is offered to you at a very moderate
fee.</p>

<p>The fee for the Modern Business Course and Service is $136 in the United
States. This covers, without any additional expense, the Texts, Talks,
Lectures, Problems Monthly Letters, Financial and Trade Reviews, Reports
and all necessary personal help. The complete set of 24 Text volumes comes
at once, and the other literature at convenient intervals.</p>

<p>If the Course is worth anything at all, the fee is slight in comparison
with the results that will follow. The fee may be paid in convenient
terms.</p>


<h3>Make your decision</h3>

<p>Certain objections may occur to you:</p>

<p><i>You have other uses for your money&mdash;</i></p>

<p>No doubt; yet none of them is as necessary to your successful business
career as the Modern Business Course and Service.</p>

<p><i>You are too busy&mdash;</i></p>

<p>Everybody who amounts to anything is busy; yet never "too busy" to acquire
knowledge so important as this.
<!--083.png--><span class="pagenum">71</span></p>

<p><i>You have a debt to pay off, or a trip to take, or you would rather "think
it over&mdash;"</i></p>

<p>These arguments are unsound from every point of view. No man, in justice
to himself, or to those who may be dependent upon him, should deny himself
this opportunity to make an investment that will yield large dividends
one, two and three years from today.</p>

<p>In the coming struggle for world markets, there will be a great need for
men of broad, executive training. For men who are prepared, there will be
more opportunities to succeed in a big way than ever before.</p>

<p>It is false economy, therefore, to postpone for a single day a decision
that will enable you to push beyond the half-way mark and forge ahead in
business.</p>

<p>You are a business man, trained to make decisions. The simple facts are
before you now. Weigh the arguments; then act.</p>

<p>In looking over the following detailed outline of the Modern Business
Course, you will see more clearly how closely every section is related to
daily business practice.</p>

<p>The italics after each title give the actual chapter headings; the

<dt>"<i>Scientific Training for Business</i>," <i>an introduction to the Modern Business Course and Service</i></dt>
<dt><i>Nature and aim of business</i></dt>
<dt><i>The profit problem</i></dt>

<p>The most important thing in business is the human element&mdash;you. Every man
must have real ambition, high ideals, and a definite goal in mind before
even a correct knowledge of business principles will help him to more than
a half-way success.</p>

<p>The purpose of this first section of the Course is to discuss the
viewpoint of the successful business man in an inspiring way, so that you
may be inspired yourself and so that you may be able to inspire others
about you.</p>

<p>"Scientific training for business" is an introduction to the whole Modern
Business Course and Service. In it Dean Johnson tells you in what way you
should read the Course, how to get the most out of it, and how to use the
equipment so as to bring results.</p>

<p>The Course begins with an analysis of business operations. It shows
briefly what are the dominant features of business life which no man can
afford to neglect. It then takes up the relation of personal qualities to
business success; it shows what personal characteristics are helpful and
how they may be cultivated; and it also points out the traits of mind,
manners and morals which hinder men in their business career. The first
point in understanding business problems and business principles is to
approach them with the right attitude of mind.</p>

<p>This section of the Course serves to bring the reader into personal touch
with the business problems which will engage his attention more in detail
in the subsequent sections and thus furnishes a useful introduction to the
entire Course.

<h3><span class="smcap">Economics&mdash;the Science of Business</span></h3>

<dl class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -2em; padding-left: 2em;">
<dt><i>Purpose and scope of economics</i></dt>
<dt><i>Fundamental concepts</i></dt>
<dt><i>Land and capital</i></dt>
<dt><i>Labor and enterprise</i></dt>
<dt><i>Three fundamental laws</i></dt>
<dt><i>Consumption of wealth</i></dt>
<dt><i>Value and the consumer</i></dt>
<dt><i>Value and the producer</i></dt>
<dt><i>Value and the trader</i></dt>
<dt><i>Money</i></dt>
<dt><i>Credit</i></dt>
<dt><i>Money, credit and prices</i></dt>
<dt><i>Foreign trade</i></dt>
<dt><i>Rent</i></dt>
<dt><i>Interest</i></dt>
<dt><i>Wages</i></dt>
<dt><i>Profits</i></dt>
</dl>

<p>Economics is the foundation stone upon which the science of business is
built. It underlies all business just as mathematics underlies all
branches of engineering. It is the basic subject of the Course, and its
general principles should be thoroughly understood before taking up the
subjects treated later.</p>

<p>The book is written for the general reader, who has little or no knowledge
of economic theory. It gives a clear idea of the business problems and
forces with which business men deal and enables the reader to form
intelligent judgments of his own.</p>

<p>This section of the Modern Business Course makes clear the laws governing
the prices of goods, the wages of employes, the profits of employers, the
processes of exchange, the functions of money and credit, and the rent of
buildings and land. It takes up in comprehensive manner the problems
raised by trade unions, by trusts, by governmental taxation and by the
growing tendency toward governmental regulation of business.</p>

<p>An understanding of all these live, interesting business problems is an
essential part of the mental equipment of a broad-gauged business man,
working under present-day conditions.

<h3><span class="smcap">Business Organization</span></h3>

<dl class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -2em; padding-left: 2em;">
<dt><i>Purpose and forms of business organizations</i></dt>
<dt><i>Sole proprietorship</i></dt>
<dt><i>General partnerships</i></dt>
<dt><i>Limited partnerships</i></dt>
<dt><i>Syndicates</i></dt>
<dt><i>Business trusts</i></dt>
<dt><i>Corporations as business units</i></dt>
<dt><i>General aspects of corporations</i></dt>
<dt><i>Incorporation of companies</i></dt>
<dt><i>Dissolution of corporations</i></dt>
<dt><i>Stock and dividends</i></dt>
<dt><i>Stockholders</i></dt>
<dt><i>Meetings of stockholders</i></dt>
<dt><i>Directors and officers</i></dt>
<dt><i>Intercorporate relations</i></dt>
<dt><i>Consolidations, sales and leases of assets</i></dt>
<dt><i>Holding companies</i></dt>
<dt><i>Illegal combinations</i></dt>
</dl>

<p>If you are in business for yourself, or in some way become interested in a
growing business, there is nothing that is of greater interest than your
rights and the rights of other men who are in the concern.</p>

<p>The application of the correct principles of production, marketing,
financing and accounting are necessary to insure success, as they
determine the profits of the business as a whole. Every man goes into
business to secure more income for himself, and the amount of his own
income will depend, not only on the amount of the profits of the whole
business, but on his own proportionate share of these profits. The
division of the profits into shares depend almost entirely on the form of
organization.</p>

<p>Moreover, when men enter business they hazard not only their time and a
definite amount of wealth in the enterprise, but perhaps other wealth that
was intended to be kept separate. Indeed, embarking on a business venture
may be but the beginning of the loss of the income of future years when
all chance of profits has ceased and the business represents nothing but a
lot of debts that remain to be liquidated.</p>

<p>Risk is an important element that is varied by the form of organization
selected. This section traces briefly the rise of the corporation through
the individual enterprise, the partnership and the joint stock company,
and states the advantages and disadvantages of each of these forms of
conducting business, as well as those of the corporation. This section of
the Course constitutes the first step in the study of corporate finance.

<dt><i>Practical limitations in applying industrial principles</i></dt>
<dt><i>Problems of employment</i></dt>
<dt><i>Employes' service</i></dt>
<dt><i>Science and management</i></dt>
</dl>

<p>Modern management of industrial plants is characterized by planning and
system. Old processes and old methods no longer command respect because
they are old. They have been subjected to searching analysis in the hope
of finding better ways of doing things. We look today not for the history,
but for the reasons of every phase of plant management.</p>

<p>This is our aspect of the general industrial changes which have
transformed modern industry and made it a high-powered productive
instrument. It is not an isolated thing, but just as significant a part of
modern business methods as are improved transportation, increased credit
and present-day banking.</p>

<p>In this part of the Course, the relation of plant management to the
characteristic development of modern life is first traced, and then the
changes displayed which scientific methods have made in the conduct of
manufacturing processes. These affect the structural organization of
business, the relations of the directing and managing organs to one
another. They also affect the operations of these managing units, the
purchase and storage of materials, the routing and sequence of work, the
best utilization of machinery and the like.</p>

<p>The keynote of the volume is efficiency in productive effort and the
principles which underlie it.

</dl>

<p>There are three different kinds of things that must be considered by
everyone who has anything to sell. One group of considerations has to do
only with personal salesmanship and sales management. Another has to do
only with advertising. Still a third is concerned solely neither with
personal salesmanship nor with advertising, but is common to both. Before
an effective force of salesmen can be selected and trained and an
advertising campaign mapped out, the plan behind the personal selling and
advertising campaign must be devised&mdash;the marketing methods must be
determined.</p>

<p>The considerations here may be grouped under three heads: the goods to be
sold, the market for the goods, and the methods of reaching that market.</p>

<p>A number of questions must be asked and answered about the things to be
sold. For example: Is there a ready demand or must one be created? Is the
commodity a necessity or a luxury? Is it subject to seasonal variations?
Is the trade-mark well known? And so on.</p>

<p>The first part of the Text, Marketing, concerns the problems of the
manufacturer; the second part, Merchandising, treats of the problems of
the dealer, both wholesaler and retailer. Between them they present a
complete picture of the processes by which goods reach the consumer, and
reveal the tendencies in modern distribution.

<dt><i>Sales contests</i></dt>
<dt><i>Sales conventions</i></dt>
</dl>

<p>There is no subject which is more universally interesting to everyone in
business than selling.</p>

<p>Salesmanship in its broadest sense is essentially the selling of one's
point of view, the ability to start with the other fellow's point of view
and lead his mind to accept yours. When an individual endeavors to
influence another, he is practising salesmanship. In this broad sense,
everyone will profit by a knowledge of the principles of salesmanship and
selling methods.</p>

<p>In this portion of the Modern Business Course, the salesman is shown the
necessity of learning something of his prospect previous to the interview.
Suggestions are also made for getting to see the buyer. The developments
in a sale are discussed in such a way as to enable the salesman to build
an effective, man-to-man transaction, and the human appeals that sell are
outlined.</p>

<p>After discussing the qualifications and duties of the sales manager,
methods to be employed in the selecting, training and handling of men are
detailed. The training of retail sales people is discussed. The planning
of the salesman's equipment, the building of a sales manual, the
apportionment of territory are gone into. Methods of keeping sales records
and statistics are outlined; directions given for the handling of sales
contests and conventions, the editing of a house organ, and the
apportioning of quotas.

<dt><i>Getting the advertisement read</i></dt>

<dt><i>Making the advertisement produce action</i></dt>
<dt><i>Human appeals in advertising</i></dt>

<dt><i>Printing art in advertising</i></dt>
<dt><i>Trade-marks, slogans and catch phrases</i></dt>
<dt><i>Legal limits and restrictions on advertising</i></dt>
</dl>

<p>Considering the large number of progressive concerns entering the field of
advertising each year, and profiting thereby, the average business man's
lack of knowledge concerning advertising principles is lamentable.</p>

<p>Few have any ability either to write or to judge copy, and almost all are
at a loss to deal intelligently with the printer.</p>

<p>This section of the Course discusses the various classes of copy divided
according to the results each is designed to accomplish. The value of word
tone in writing and how to secure it are indicated. Instructions for
preparing and laying out the advertisement are given.</p>

<p>The technique of the printing art&mdash;type faces, paper, printing processes,
half-tones and line-cut illustrations&mdash;is discussed.</p>

<p>The advertising slogan, the package design and the various considerations
in connection with the trade-mark are treated.</p>

<p>The business man is prepared to correlate the principles of advertising
with those of marketing methods, and to bring an understanding of both to
his study of advertising problems of wholesale and retail merchandising.

<h3><span class="smcap">Office Administration</span></h3>

<dl class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -2em; padding-left: 2em;">
<dt><i>The office in modern business</i></dt>
<dt><i>Location, planning and layout of the office</i></dt>
<dt><i>Office equipment and supplies</i></dt>
<dt><i>Office appliances</i></dt>
<dt><i>Selection of employes</i></dt>

<dt><i>Training</i></dt>
<dt><i>Stimulation of employes</i></dt>
<dt><i>Filing</i></dt>
<dt><i>Interdepartmental communications</i></dt>
<dt><i>Office manuals</i></dt>
<dt><i>The worker's compensation</i></dt>
<dt><i>Welfare</i></dt>
<dt><i>Office organization</i></dt>
<dt><i>Planning</i></dt>
<dt><i>Office control</i></dt>
<dt><i>Work reports and their use</i></dt>
<dt><i>The art of management</i></dt>
</dl>

<p>It is only in recent years that individual business enterprises outside of
the manufacturing field have grown to such importance as to bring a large
number of employes under one management. Today the problems of the office
are no less urgent than those of the shop.</p>

<p>Office administration is in some respects like, in other respects unlike,
plant management. It is alike in that it pursues the same ideals of
efficiency. It is unlike in that machines and equipment fall into the
background and the human element looms large in the foreground of office
work.</p>

<p>Methods of conducting clerical work have, since the advent of the various
office machines, of which the typewriter was the pioneer, undergone rapid
transformation. Underlying these changes there have been principles, more
or less clearly recognized, which it is the aim of the Text to discover
and present in an orderly and systematic fashion.</p>

<p>In few departments of office work have standardized processes based upon
scientific principles made such headway as in the employment field. Hiring
employes for office work, training them for their duties, stimulating them
to their best effort, adjusting wages to work performed, and providing for
deserved promotions, are no longer casual occupations of some general
offices, but the work and special concern of the trained office manager.</p>

<p>Here, as elsewhere, concentration and specialization are beginning to
reveal the principles underlying successful effort. Such principles
concern not only the operations, but the organization of the office and
its various parts.

<h3><span class="smcap">Accounting Principles</span></h3>

<dl class="blockquot" style="text-indent: -2em; padding-left: 2em;">

<dt><i>Double entry bookkeeping</i></dt>
<dt><i>Books of account</i></dt>
<dt><i>Applying accounting principles&mdash;the original entries</i></dt>
<dt><i>Applying accounting principles&mdash;the ledger records</i></dt>

<dt><i>Single entry bookkeeping</i></dt>
<dt><i>Continental system of bookkeeping</i></dt>
<dt><i>Depreciation</i></dt>
<dt><i>Methods of computing depreciation</i></dt>
<dt><i>Labor-saving devices</i></dt>
<dt><i>Internal checks</i></dt>
</dl>

<p>As business becomes more complex we are more and more dependent upon
accounting methods to show us the trend of the individual business in
which we are interested.</p>

<p>Hence a knowledge of accounting principles is indispensable. Yet, even
among experienced bookkeepers, comparatively few have a clear
understanding of the principles which underlie all correct methods of
keeping financial records.</p>

<p>This section of the Course, therefore, starts with a clear explanation of
the fundamental principles of bookkeeping, and progresses step by step
until it reaches the most complicated cases of partnership and corporation
accounting.</p>

<p>Within recent years the great importance of proper accounting methods in
the conduct of business has come to be fully recognized.</p>

<p>This section of the Course should enable any executive or accountant to
determine what accounting methods are best adapted to his own line of
business.

<dt><i>Credit protection</i></dt>
<dt><i>Bankruptcy</i></dt>
<dt><i>The role of the credit department in developing business</i></dt>
</dl>

<p>When a bill of goods is sold, the transaction is by no means
complete&mdash;that is, if the sale is on credit. The purchaser must pay the
bill. But some purchasers cannot pay, others will not; therefore caution
must be exercised in granting credit, and pressure brought to bear in
obtaining payment.</p>

<p>Often seekers after credit are foolishly offended at the questions they
must answer. They do not realize how personal is the favor they are
asking, nor do they usually understand the combination of factors which
the credit man must consider.</p>

<p>These factors range all the way from personal habits of the applicant to a
survey of general business conditions.</p>

<p>There is a well-organized machinery for gathering credit information both
in this country and abroad. This machinery, however, should be
supplemented by the personal observation of the salesmen, many of whom now
fail to cooperate in the right spirit with the credit manager.</p>

<p>The credit operation is incomplete till the goods are paid for;
collections are the complement of credit granting, and they receive an
extended treatment in the Text. As a last resource, the law may be
resorted to, as is evident in the treatment of credit protection and
bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The possibilities of the credit department as an agency in building up
business, which have not always been understood, are set forth in the
concluding chapter.

<p>Nearly all of us are constantly receiving and sending letters, and we know
in our experience the common types&mdash;the nasty letter, the sloppy letter,
the cold-as-an-iceberg letter, and, on the other hand, the direct yet
cordial letter which makes us feel as if we had gripped a friendly hand.</p>

<p>The profit-making influence of good correspondence can hardly be
overestimated.</p>

<p>A good sales letter may be the means of getting thousands of dollars'
worth of business; a poor adjustment letter may be the cause of losing a
worth-while customer.</p>

<p>To a large extent business must be carried on by means of letters, and
there are few subjects of more vital importance to the business man than
business correspondence.</p>

<p>Business letters always have a direct purpose in view and there are
certain underlying principles which should be observed in all business
letters, whatever their particular purpose. But these letters serve many
different purposes, and some of the prominent types and their
characteristics are treated.</p>

<p>Especial attention is given to sales correspondence, which forms a most

</dl>

<p>Of late years, and as a direct result of growing competition in all
branches of industrial enterprise, the subject of cost is receiving
increased attention.</p>

<p>Every year sees hundreds of progressive concerns adopting methods designed
to ascertain the real cost of producing and selling goods and of managing
a business enterprise.</p>

<p>Manufacturers are no longer satisfied with merely making a profit. They
want to know what lines are paying and what lines are not&mdash;not in a
general way, but specifically in actual figures. They want to know which
departments are producing economically and which are not.</p>

<p>In this part of the Course, the various methods of keeping track of costs
are described and illustrated. Particular attention is given to the mixed
question of allotting general factory expense or burden.</p>

<p>The possibilities of predicting costs are fully discussed and the
significance of this development of cost finding methods is fully
impressed upon the reader.</p>

<p>The problem of costs is one of the widest application in business
management and its significance in different lines of business is pointed
out.

<dt><i>The trader's campaign</i></dt>
<dt><i>The campaign as a whole</i></dt>
</dl>

<p>In the Modern Business Course and Service the study of advertising is
divided into three parts. First, in Marketing Methods there is a complete
presentation of the plan behind the campaign&mdash;of the things that have to
be considered by anyone who has anything to sell, before he sends out
salesmen or prepares advertising.</p>

<p>The section of Advertising Principles shows what advertising can do for
business, guides one in choosing the right advertising appeal, and treats
of the technique of advertising, writing the copy, preparing the
illustrations, and getting the advertisement before the public.</p>

<p>There is much more to advertising, however, than the making of a
preliminary study of the writing of advertisements.</p>

<p>The advertiser has to consider problems of organization, methods of
identifying his goods, his relation with agencies, the selection of media,
distribution, dealer cooperation, and a host of other things, all of which
have an important part in the complete campaign.</p>

<p>This section deals with the many essential parts of an advertising
campaign which have not been considered in preceding sections of the
Modern Business Course. It gathers together all the diverse considerations
of the advertiser, shows their relation one to another, and binds them
into a unified whole.

<dt><i>Selling stocks and bonds</i></dt>
<dt><i>Financing the small company</i></dt>
<dt><i>Financing reorganizations</i></dt>
</dl>

<p>The advantages of the corporation have made it the most popular form of
financial organization, and nearly all business men are now interested in
one way or another in the formation or management of corporations, or in
the buying and selling of the stock and securities of corporations.</p>

<p>The stability of practically every business concern depends in a very
large measure upon the keenness of judgment used in its financial
management.</p>

<p>This section of the Course enables one to think along financial lines with
accuracy and decision. The methods by which corporations are promoted and
financed are fully described, and the principles that underlie successful
corporate management are stated.</p>

<p>The different kinds of bonds, such as mortgage bonds, collateral trust
bonds, bonds secured by leases, etc., are explained and the methods of
selling them discussed.</p>

<p>There are sections on capital and its maintenance and a full discussion of
income, dividends and surplus that will be of value to the executive and
to the investor.</p>

<p>In the last three chapters the application of the principles of
corporation finance to the small company is fully described.

<dt><i>The Transportation Act</i></dt>
<dt><i>Inland water transportation</i></dt>
</dl>

<p>Business as it is conducted today would not be possible without the
railroad.</p>

<p>The corner grocery store as well as the big manufacturing company is
directly affected by traffic, rates and methods. The prosperity of many a
business and community is largely dependent upon relations with
transportation companies. Yet many business men are unfamiliar with even
the elements of rate making and traffic handling.</p>

<p>The war made great changes in railroad organization and when the railroads
were returned at the close of the war to their former owners a new set of
problems had to be faced. Rail rates had assumed a new importance, labor
and other costs had increased and both shipper and carrier were called
upon to consider transportation in an entirely different light than before
the war. All of these problems receive careful consideration in this Text,
and the tendencies of the times, so far as they have been clearly
revealed, are pointed out.</p>

<p>Classifications, rates, special services, terminal facilities and charges
are some of the specific questions discussed.

<p>The events of recent years have turned the attention of business men of
America once more to the problems of foreign trade.</p>

<p>This section of the Course describes the development of our trade with
foreign countries. It describes various changes which are at work in this
field and the methods by which foreign trade is conducted.</p>

<p>Intimately associated with this subject is that of shipping; the
transportation problems involved in foreign trade, questions of routes,
rates, registry and the like are given particular attention.</p>

<p>The advantages and disadvantages of American and foreign shipping and the
problems involved in the up-building of an American merchant marine
receive careful consideration.

<dt><i>The Federal Reserve system</i></dt>
<dt><i>State banks and trust companies</i></dt>
</dl>

<p>Business concerns deal in bank credit every day. They have on deposit
large amounts of their capital. They rely upon their banks' stability. And
yet how few can read a bank statement with real insight and judgment.</p>

<p>The fundamental principles underlying all banking operations are presented
under this heading. The nature of money and its relation to credit and
capital are described, and the conditions which lead to a general rise or
fall of prices are set forth.</p>

<p>The important banking and monetary experiences of the United States are
reviewed and full descriptions of the banking systems of the United
States, Canada, England, France and Germany are given.</p>

<p>In connection with banking, the source of the banker's lending power and
its relation to cash on hand are indicated, as well as the distinction
between the bank note and the bank deposit, and the factors controlling
the rate of discount.</p>

<p>Banking practice is in large part a study of the banking laws and customs
prevalent in the United States, including those governing Federal Reserve
Banks, State banks and trust companies.</p>

<p>The subject is fully discussed in this part of the Course, as are also the
technical aspects of banking in all details.

<h3><span class="smcap">International Exchange</span></h3>

<dt><i>London and New York as financial centers</i></dt>
<dt><i>War and the exchanges</i></dt>
<dt><i>Tables</i></dt>
</dl>

<p>The early part of this section of the Course deals with inland exchange
and describes the method by which settlements are made between different
parts of the same country. When this is fully understood the problem of
foreign exchange becomes very simple. It is the application of the same
principles complicated only by the difference in money units between
different countries.</p>

<p>The "Foreign Exchange" department of banking is of such great importance
and presents so many difficult questions that it deserves and is accorded
special treatment. The reader is given a full description of the mechanism
of the exchange market and is shown how money is made in foreign
exchanges.</p>

<p>He learns how the vast amount of export and import trade is made possible
through the interrelations between the foreign exchange markets of New
York, London, Paris and other large centers. He also learns concretely how
foreign shipments are financed and is given some valuable information
concerning the influence of gold and other factors upon foreign exchange
rates.</p>

<p>An important feature of this section is a thorough discussion of the best
methods of handling export shipments. Many American and Canadian
manufacturers are considering the advisability of going after foreign
trade with greater vigor. They are usually puzzled when it comes to
considering how to finance these shipments, which are often a long time in
transit. The growing importance of export trade makes this section of the
Course particularly valuable.

<dt><i>Fire insurance</i></dt>
<dt><i>Fire insurance policies</i></dt>
<dt><i>Marine insurance</i></dt>
<dt><i>Other forms of insurance</i></dt>
</dl>

<p>Insurance constitutes a form of investment in which we are all interested,
as purchasers of life insurance, fire insurance, casualty insurance,
marine insurance, or of any other of the various forms which have come
into existence. To buy insurance properly, one should know the principles
that underlie rates and insurance operations, and should be able to judge
the policy which covers these various essentials. Partnership and business
insurance is much more used now than it has been heretofore and it is
becoming an important element in adding to the stability of business.</p>

<p>Personal or life insurance occupies a large space in the Text. The nature
of the life risk is discussed as well as the means of protection through
the straight life policy. The various motives which have prompted these
variations and the effect of these modifications upon the premium or the
price of insurance are clearly explained. Various types of business
organizations with divergent business methods have been devised for the
purpose of conducting life insurance. The strength and weakness of the
different organization forms are pointed out.</p>

<p>Another aspect of personal insurance is found in accident and health
insurance. Obligations toward others generally for personal injuries is
the basis of liability and workmen's compensation insurance, of which the
latter has had an almost mushroom development of late years.</p>

<p>Property insurance brings up diverse questions in fire insurance and in
marine insurance.

<p>Almost every man in business comes into contact with some one of the
exchanges.</p>

<p>Therefore, a detailed description of the organization, operation and
management of the principal security and raw material markets of the world
is of inestimable value. This is the aim of this section of the Modern
Business Course and Service.</p>

<p>Speculation in goods and in stocks exists because it performs an economic
service. It saves the manufacturer of cotton goods or flour, for example,
from gambling by an operation known as hedging. Business men should
understand how speculation performs this service.</p>

<p>The volume closes with a discussion of corners and of the influences
governing security and produce prices.

<p>This section deals with the application of the principles of accounting to
the complicated problems that arise in practice. The correct method of
treating the proprietary accounts under the different legal types of
organization are considered. The management of surplus, the treatment of
reserves, the relation between funds and reserves and the method of
handling sinking funds are discussed at length.</p>

<p>The differentiation between capital and revenue charges is perhaps the
most difficult problem which the accountant has to face. The important
principles involved in this problem are treated with numerous examples
taken from actual cases. The difficult problems which arise in partnership
and corporate accounting are fully explained.</p>

<p>Auditing is taken up from the business man's point of view rather than
from the point of view of the practitioner. However, many points of
interest to the practitioner and student are considered. The nature of the
auditor's work is discussed and the different classes of engagements which
auditors undertake are explained.</p>

<p>The auditor renders a report on his work at the conclusion of his
engagement and the form and contents of his report are treated at length.
The subscriber is shown the difference in certificates which auditors
attach to balance sheets and the proper method of interpreting them is
discussed.

<p>The business man must understand accounting as far as he uses accounting
knowledge in interpreting the progress of his business.</p>

<p>He wants not so much the details of accounting technique as the
information necessary to enable him to use his accounting records
properly. No one can expect to succeed in a big way without the ability to
read financial and business statements&mdash;both on the lines and between the
lines.</p>

<p>In every business the executive deals with a great variety of reports,
statements, statistics and charts. This volume is designed to set forth
the principles and to describe the methods by which they should be
interpreted.</p>

<p>In the discussion of private and public budgets is included data that will
be of the utmost value to every business man. You will find a thorough
discussion of budget making and a clear outline of what should and what
should not be done.</p>

<p>Instructions for the analysis of the reports and financial statements of
industrial organizations and railway companies are set forth.

<p>The Course opens with the personal relations of a man to a business and
continues with an analysis of the various activities which constitute
modern business. In this section it closes with the manifold relations of
business to government.</p>

<p>Business is, as it were, in partnership with the government. In this
partnership the government is active, as there are government departments
aiming to promote business in manufactures and in trading.</p>

<p>Business, of course, cannot exist without government, and as the war
demonstrated, government cannot exist without business. Business is
restive, however, under the close supervision wrought of war necessities.
How far is such supervision justified in times of peace?</p>

<p>This is a question both of principle and expediency and all its aspects
are brought out in the discussion of specific problems, the tariff, trusts
and corporations, public utilities, national and local, and the like.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
